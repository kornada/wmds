globCover2009,,,GlobCover2009 surface cover classification,GlobCover 2009 land cover map is derived by an automatic and regionally-tuned classification of a time series of global MERIS FR mosaics for the year 2009. The global land cover map counts 22 land cover classes defined with the United Nations (UN) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS).

laifpar,,,LAI/fPAR surface cover classification,Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fractional Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR). FPAR/LAI is the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active radiation that a plant canopy absorbs for photosynthesis and growth in the 0.4 - 0.7nm spectral range.
lccs,,,LCCS surface cover classification,"FAO/UNEP land cover classification scheme (LCCS), a comprehensive, standardized a priori classification system, independent of the scale or means used to map. The system can be used for any land cover classification initiative anywhere in the world, using a set of independent diagnostic criteria that allow correlation with existing classifications and legends."
