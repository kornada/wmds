chaotic,,,Chaotic (City centre with high and low-rise buildings),Centres of large towns with mixture of low-rise and high-rise buildings. Also irregular large forests with many clearings. (zo ≥ 2)
closed,,,"Closed (Regular large obstacle COVER (suburb, forest))","Landscape totally and quite regularly covered with similar size large obstacles, with open spaces comparable to the obstacle heights; e.g. mature regular forests, homogeneous cities or villages. (zo 1.0)"
inapplicable,,,(Inapplicable),None of the codes in the table are applicable in the context of this particular observation.
open,,,"Open (Open flat terrain; grass, few isolated obstacles)","Level country with low vegetation (e.g. grass) and isolated obstacles with separations of at least 50 obstacle heights; e.g. grazing land without windbreaks, heather, moor and tundra, runway area of airports. (z0 0.03)"
rough,,,"Rough (High crops; scattered obstacles, 15 < x/H < 20)","Recently-developed ""young"" landscape with high crops or crops of varying height, and scattered obstacles (e.g. dense shelterbelts, vineyards) at relative distances of about 15 obstacle heights. (zo 0.25)"
roughlyOpen,,,"Roughly open (Low crops; occasional large obstacles, x/H > 20)","Cultivated area with regular cover of low crops, or moderately open country with occasional obstacles (e.g. low hedges, single rows of trees, isolated farms) at relative horizontal distances of at least 20 obstacle heights. (zo 0.10)"
sea,,,"Sea (open water, tidal flat, snow with fetch above 3 km","Open sea or lake (irrespective of the wave size), tidal flat, snow-covered flat plain, featureless desert, tarmac and concrete, with a free fetch of several kilometers. (zo 0.0002)"
smooth,,,"Smooth (Mud flats, snow; no vegetation, no obstacles)","Featureless land surface without any noticeable obstacles and with negligible vegetation; e.g. beaches, pack ice without large ridges, morass, and snow-covered or fallow open country. (zo 0.005)"
veryRough,,,"Very rough (Parkland, bushes; numerous obstacles, x/H ~ 10)","""Old"" cultivated landscape with many rather large obstacle groups (large farms, clumps of forest) separated by open spaces of about 10 obstacle heights. Also low large vegetation with small interspaces, such as bushland, orchards, young densely-planted forest. (zo 0.5)"
