chaotic,,,Chaotic,Centres of large towns with mixture of low-rise and high-rise buildings. Also irregular large forests with many clearings. (zo ≥ 2)
closed,,,Closed,"Landscape totally and quite regularly covered with similar size large obstacles, with open spaces comparable to the obstacle heights; e.g. mature regular forests, homogeneous cities or villages. (zo 1.0)"
open,,,Open,"Level country with low vegetation (e.g. grass) and isolated obstacles with separations of at least 50 obstacle heights; e.g. grazing land without windbreaks, heather, moor and tundra, runway area of airports. (z0 0.03)"
roughlyOpen,,,Roughly open,"Cultivated area with regular cover of low crops, or moderately open country with occasional obstacles (e.g. low hedges, single rows of trees, isolated farms) at relative horizontal distances of at least 20 obstacle heights. (zo 0.10)"
rough,,,Rough,"Recently-developed ""young"" landscape with high crops or crops of varying height, and scattered obstacles (e.g. dense shelterbelts, vineyards) at relative distances of about 15 obstacle heights. (zo 0.25)"
